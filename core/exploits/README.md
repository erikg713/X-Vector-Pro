Available Exploits

Below is a list of all the exploits included in this tool. Each exploit is designed for specific use cases in penetration testing and cybersecurity research.

Exploit Name	Description	Category

CVE-2024-10960	A Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit targeting a vulnerability in the Brizy WordPress plugin. The exploit allows the uploading of a PHP shell via an insecure file upload mechanism.	Exploits
Brute Force Login	A brute-force attack aimed at guessing user credentials for various login forms (WordPress, SSH, etc.) using wordlists or custom combinations.	Brute Force
Port Scan	Scans a target system to identify open ports and associated services. This is useful for identifying potential entry points.	Scanning
Recon - Passive	Performs passive reconnaissance by gathering publicly available information about a target, such as DNS records, WHOIS data, and social engineering insights.	Reconnaissance
Web Shell Upload	Uploads a malicious web shell to a vulnerable web server by exploiting insecure file upload functionality in the target's web application.	Exploits
SQL Injection	Exploits a vulnerability in web applications by injecting malicious SQL queries to extract, modify, or delete data in the database.	Exploits
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)	An exploit that injects malicious scripts into a webpage viewed by other users, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on behalf of users.	Exploits
Directory Traversal	A vulnerability exploit that allows attackers to access files and directories outside the web server's root directory by manipulating file paths.	Exploits
Open Redirect	Exploits vulnerable redirect functionality in web applications, which could be used to redirect users to malicious websites.	Exploits
Command Injection	Exploits vulnerable applications by injecting arbitrary commands that the system executes, allowing attackers to take control of the server.	Exploits
